## Setup guide:

	get git repository from the following location
	--
<<<<<<< HEAD

	All build work is done within the App folder, which in turn will output to the client folder.

## Notes

	The project is all output to the folder: client

	The project is all built within the App folder.

	Use gulp to build everything, ideally just run 'gulp watch' to get it up and going. This will also
	start a Browser Sync that will run on a local host.

	All the data for each location is stored in the folder : app/views/data/

		This is where the image folder, name, copy and text is all stored. Update this to update the content
		loaded into the build.
